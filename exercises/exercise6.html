            <p>
                I am Yifan, currently a junior, majoring in Informatics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
                I have experience with programming languages like React, Python, JavaScript, and Linux. 
                I am passionate about building projects with real-world impact, full-stack development, and AWS cloud computing. 
                I am currently looking for internship opportunities in SWE, Data Science, and Business Analytics.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the moment, I am leading a small team with the UMass Biology Department, 
                taking initiatives on website migration and managing databases. 
                Outside academics, I am a skilled pianist and love playing video gamesâ€”my recent favorite is CS:GO. 
                I also love traveling and have been to 7 countries.
